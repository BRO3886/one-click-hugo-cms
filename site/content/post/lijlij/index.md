I am writing to express my interest in joining Zeller's Payments Engineering team. With my experience in building scalable systems and working with modern cloud architectures, I believe I can contribute effectively to Zeller's mission of reimagining business banking and payments.

My experience aligns well with Zeller's technical requirements. At Zomato, I've worked extensively with Go and AWS cloud native architectures, particularly focusing on event-driven systems. I led the development of the "Near and Fast" feature, building a comprehensive pipeline using AWS services including DynamoDB and Redis for efficient data syncing and caching. During my time at Groww, a leading fintech platform, I gained valuable experience in financial services technology by redesigning their Help and Support Microservice with a modular architecture.

I am particularly interested in building new integration solutions using websockets and Go, and taking end-to-end ownership of features while maintaining high quality and performance standards. My experience with microservices and event-driven architectures would be valuable in helping build and scale Zeller's payment solutions.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in distributed systems and financial services technology could contribute to Zeller's continued growth.
